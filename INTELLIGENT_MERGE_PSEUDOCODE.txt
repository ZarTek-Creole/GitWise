Pseudocode for Intelligent Branch Merging Feature:

1. Input: Source branch, Target branch.
2. Pre-merge analysis:
   a. Check the commit history of both branches for common ancestors.
   b. Determine the files changed in both branches since the common ancestor.
   c. Detect overlapping changes in the same files to identify potential conflicts.
3. If potential conflicts are detected:
   a. List the conflicting files and the nature of conflicts.
   b. Suggest possible resolutions:
      - Manual resolution by developers.
      - Automated resolutions using predefined patterns.
      - Consultation with code owners or experts.
4. If no conflicts or after conflict resolution:
   a. Perform a test merge (dry run) to confirm that no runtime issues will occur.
   b. Provide a summary report of the test merge, including any warnings or errors.
5. If the test merge is successful:
   a. Ask the user for confirmation to proceed with the actual merge.
   b. Merge the branches and push the changes to the remote repository if applicable.
6. Post-merge:
   a. Verify the stability of the target branch with automated tests.
   b. Notify stakeholders of the merge completion and any follow-up actions required.
