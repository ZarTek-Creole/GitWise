Test Scenarios for GitWise 'check' Command
==========================================

Scenario 1: No Changes in the Repository
----------------------------------------
- Given a Git repository with no pending changes
- When the user executes the 'gitwise check' command
- Then the output should indicate that the repository is clean
- And no further actions should be suggested

Scenario 2: Uncommitted Changes Detected
----------------------------------------
- Given a Git repository with uncommitted changes (e.g., added, modified, or deleted files)
- When the user executes the 'gitwise check' command
- Then the output should list the uncommitted changes
- And suggest appropriate actions such as committing the changes or reviewing them

Scenario 3: Untracked Files Present
-----------------------------------
- Given a Git repository with untracked files present
- When the user executes the 'gitwise check' command
- Then the output should list the untracked files
- And suggest actions such as adding the files to the repository or ignoring them

These scenarios will be further developed to include test steps, expected results, and potential automated testing scripts.
