# Versioning Strategy for GitWise

GitWise will use semantic versioning. This means:

- Major releases (1.0.0, 2.0.0) will include significant changes and potential backward-incompatible changes.
- Minor releases (1.1.0, 1.2.0) will include new features and improvements.
- Patch releases (1.0.1, 1.0.2) will include bug fixes and minor improvements.
